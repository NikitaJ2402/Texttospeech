# Texttospeech
This project is a Text-to-Speech (TTS) Generator, designed to convert user-inputted text into speech. It provides a user-friendly interface for converting text into audio files in various languages, with customizable speech speed. The project is developed as a web application using Streamlit, a library for creating data apps, and gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech), a Python library that interfaces with Google's Text-to-Speech API.

Libraries Used
Streamlit: For creating the web-based user interface.
gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech): To generate the speech audio from the provided text.
os: To handle file management tasks such as saving and deleting audio files.
Project Features
Accepts text input from users through a text area.
Provides a selection of multiple languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Hindi).
Offers an option to control speech speed (normal or slow).
Generates and plays the audio output directly on the webpage.
Deletes the temporary audio file after playback.
Topic
The project focuses on Text-to-Speech Conversion, which is a part of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Artificial Intelligence. This application can be used in accessibility tools, voice assistants, and other domains requiring text-based audio conversion.
